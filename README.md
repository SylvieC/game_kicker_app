** GAME KICKER_APP

Technologies used: 
 * Ruby on Rails
 * gem 'tts' (text-to-speed) from Google Translate to create the audio files 

This Ruby on Rails app guides the user in setting up the popular board game  Avalon.
Before the game starts, once the players know their loyalty, a Leader must recite a long text to ensure that some players know about some specific other players. This text varies according to the characters chosen. To simplify the leader's role, an audio file corresponding to the characters chosen can be played

This unique app goes as follows:
1. The user enters the number of players
2. The page displays the number of characters needed for each side (the good side and the evil side)
3. Once the user has chosen the optional characters, he clicks  the button 'Done'
4. An audio file appears. The user can listen to this audio file corresponding to the game chosen.

Good playing! It is a fun strategic game!
