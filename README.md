 ## GAME KICKER

Technologies used: 
 * Ruby on Rails
 * gem 'tts' (text-to-speed) from Google Translate to create the audio files 

This Ruby on Rails app guides the user in setting up the popular strategic board game Avalon.
Before the game starts and once the players know their loyalty, a Leader must recite a long text to ensure that some players know about some specific other players. He has to recite it because all the players have their eyes closed. This text varies according to the characters chosen. There are 14 different versions, according to the 14 possible combinations of characters possible. To simplify the Leader's role, an audio file corresponding to the characters chosen is played instead. 

This unique app goes as follows:

1. The user enters the number of players
2. The page displays the number of characters needed for each side (the good side and the evil side)
3. Once the user has chosen the optional characters, he clicks  the button 'Done'
4. An audio file appears. The players can listen to this audio file corresponding to the game chosen. They just have to follow the instruction. 

Good playing! It is a fun strategic game!
